# CAWS Data Mapper Creater Program Thing

Only works with python3

Run this to get the necessary packages

```
pip install openpyxl
```

---

Steps:

- Import an excel file (the bigger your excel file, the more space you will need)
- Tick the headers that you want to see in the output file
- Open the input mapping file

The program will now create a file called "output.txt" in the same directory as it is running and output the mapping

Things that don't work

- Cant add in columns that didn't exist in the original file
- Open two excel files, one after the other. Close and reopen the program
- Change the name or the place the output file gets saved
- Your mum
